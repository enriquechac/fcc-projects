                Porfirio Diaz (1830-1915) became a war hero during the French invasion of 1861, helping to defeat the invaders at the famous Battle of Puebla on May 5, 1862.
                Diaz entered politics and followed the rising star of Benito Juarez, although the two men did not get along well personally.

                By 1876, Diaz had grown tired of trying to reach the Presidential palace via democratic means. That year, he entered Mexico City with an army and not surprisingly won the "election" he set up himself. Diaz ruled unchallenged for the next 35 years.

                During his reign, Mexico was greatly modernized, building railroads and infrastructure and developing industries and commerce that allowed the country to join the international community. 
                However, since all of Mexico's wealth was concentrated in the hands of a few, life for ordinary Mexicans had never been worse. The wealth disparity led to the Mexican Revolution, which exploded in 1910.

                By 1911, Diaz was ousted. He died in exile in 1915.
